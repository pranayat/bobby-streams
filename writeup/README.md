This repository contains the LaTeX sources for your Thesis.
Do *not* commit the compiled pdf!

This repository has a GitLab Runner which builds the pdf everytime you push.
The runner will complain if your TeX sources do not compile.
For easy online viewing, the resulting artifact is kept [here](https://git.cs.uni-kl.de/dbis/msc-thesis-pranaya-tomar/-/jobs/artifacts/main/file/Thesis.pdf?job=writing).
If you move or rename the main tex file, you need to also edit the runner configuration.
